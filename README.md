# Titanic-data-analysis
Survival rate: the analysis began by determining the overall survival rate on the titanic. Approximately 50.58% of passengers survived the disaster.

Surival rate by Pclass: The survivsl rate was then broken down by passenger class(Pclass). It was found that passengers in higher classes(1st class) had a higher chance of survival compared to those in lower classes(2nd and 3rd class).

Gender and survival: Gender and survival were analyzed, revealing that gender and survival were correlated, showing females survived more than males.

Siblings/Spouse and survival: The survival rate varied based on the number of siblingsnor spouses a passenger had.
survival by port of embarkation: The survival rate based on the port of embarkation was calculated. Passengers from different embarkation ports had varying survival rates.

fare and survival: The coefficient indicated whether higher fare-paying passengers had a better chance ofsurvival.
age and pclass correlation: A scatterplot was used to visualize the correlation between age and Pclass.

# Additional insights:
  The analysis provided a comprehensive understanding of the titanic dataset, including factors influencing survival rates, correlation between variables, and opportunities for further exploration. its important to note that specific percentages,average ages, and insights would depend on the actual dataset used and may vary accordingly.
